# Gender-and-Age-Detection-
This Python program detects faces in an image and predicts the gender and age range of each person using OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models. It uses a face detection network to locate faces, then applies gender and age classification models to analyze each detected face. The results are printed in the console and displayed on the image.
